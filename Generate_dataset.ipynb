    "    {\"question\": \"What is not at issue according to the author?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"Let’s be clear about what is and is not at issue here.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"What does the author think about deploying robotic soldiers?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"First, I am not talking about whether or not we should deploy robotic soldiers. That is an ethical decision that is in human hands.\"},\n",

    "    \"answer\": \"The dilemma is as follows: A train is out of control and moving at top speed down a track. At the end of the track, five people are tied down, and will be killed in seconds. There is a switch that can divert the train to another track but, unfortunately, another person is tied down on that track, and will be crushed if you pull the switch.\"},\n",

    "    {\"question\": \"What does the author suggest about overcoming horror in ethical decisions as the number of people increases?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"Of course, as we increase the number of people on the track, there is a point at which most of us think that we will overcome our horror and sacrifice the life of the lone commuter in order to save the five, 10, one hundred or one thousand victims tied to the track.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"What does the author say about people who do the right thing despite it being horrible?\", \n",

    "    {\"question\": \"What is the author's view on robotic doctors and HIPAA compliance?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"It would not seem unreasonable for a machine to respond for a request for personal information by saying 'I am sorry but he is my patient and that information is protected.' In much the same way that Apple protected its encryption in the face of homeland security, it follows that robotic doctors will be asked to be HIPAA compliant.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"How does the author describe machines' reaction to the Trolley Dilemma?\", \n",

    "    {\"question\": \"What is crucial for systems of machine intelligence according to the author?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"So, as with all other aspects of machine intelligence, it is crucial that these systems are able to explain their moral decisions to us.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"What will machines need to do to explain their reasoning according to the author?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"They will need to be able to reach into their silicon souls and explain the reasoning that supports their actions.\"},\n",
    "    {\"question\": \"What does the author guess about machines explaining themselves?\", \n",
    "    \"answer\": \"And my guess is that they will be able to explain themselves better than we do.\"},\n",

And that is, the need to communicate and the goal to communicate is absolutely the driver for every single piece of analysis that you need.

And one of the tremendous powers of building a system that actually looks at the data and figures out what's happening is, it can then explain itself to you. And rather than giving you an answer, what it can do is, it can give you an answer and an explanation. An answer doesn't make you smarter, actually an answer kind of makes you look like an idiot because you go someplace and somebody says, 'Well, I mean who's the best sales guy?' and you say, 'Frank's the best sales guy.' And it's like, 'Really? Why?' And it's like, 'Well, the system told me that.' Like, that's really a shame. But if you say, 'Frank's the best sales guy because, in fact, his volume is up. His volume is up, he's got more of a spread on product. He is making five times the number of calls of anybody else in the office, and whenever he meets with anybody, his goal is to close.

We almost immediately took that code base and ripped it apart because, in order to do client after client, it meant we had to actually modify the code, and we wanted to stop modifying the code. So we ripped it apart, and we built it into something that could be configured. It was configured using a markup language called Yamo. We won't discuss the pros and cons of Yamo, but my guess is almost everyone in the room has not heard of it, which is one of the cons. And we could start configuring the system without changing the code base. Then we wrote on top of that something that we call initially called Pilot, and now is all full tilt Quill.

Our goal, and I'd be damned if I will not live to see this, our goal is to rid the world of the spreadsheet. And to have people look at spreadsheets the way people look at computer punch cards, that is, it's a quaint, old school way of having the machine communicate with us. And the notion, the notion that we would force ourselves to look at a spreadsheet to figure out what the machine knows will be considered an abomination. Because it will know everything. Every day it knows more, and in fact, in order to make it a cooperative partner, we have to make it smart enough in order to explain what it knows to us, in our terms, in our way.

And what we've actually found is that if you start looking at the things you want to communicate, you can turn these into explicit communication goals. And those communication goals will have information needs, those information needs can be satisfied by analysis, and the analysis has very clear data specs associated with it. And that is, the need to communicate and the goal to communicate is absolutely the driver for every single piece of analysis that you need. And if you're doing analysis that doesn't have communication associated with it, either with a human being or another machine, then in fact your analysis is a waste of time, and we take that stance fairly strongly.\"\n",

Now, you actually, just, well, let's see, who has kids who are getting ready for college, by college, alright, who has kids, who think about high school, who took a standardized test relatively recently, alright, you get back the results and those results are stellar, aren't they? They tell you you got a 97. I hope you all got 97, they tell you how to 97, you're in the 98th percentile. If you're taking this test as part of a test prep plan, a preparation for taking more tests, it will tell you whether or not you are doing better or worse. That is tremendous information. It's not really actionable, you can't do anything with that. To know where you stand doesn't tell you what to do. But it turns out that the reason why there are questions on those tests is because they are targeting information that they want you to have.

The more interesting part of the job is this. That is, once you've figured out that something is wrong in the data, or something is wrong in the world as evidenced by the data, you need to tell somebody. Now, if you tell somebody, and by the way, red, green, yellow is the mechanism that is usually used to tell people these things. Red, green, yellow, and rule 75 is what the kind of information that people get on dashboards. If you give somebody the information that Smith's Auto Sales is doing something wrong, then they have to go and figure out why.
