And what we've actually found is that if you start looking at the things you want to communicate, you can turn these into explicit communication goals. And those communication goals will have information needs, those information needs can be satisfied by analysis, and the analysis has very clear data specs associated with it. And that is, the need to communicate and the goal to communicate is absolutely the driver for every single piece of analysis that you need.

You have to actually look at how everybody else is doing, what the stats are on every single question that you answered. You have to understand where the materials come from, what's being tested. You have to have metadata around the questions and answers. This is a document that human beings will never build because you can't do it at scale. You can test at scale, you can score at scale, but human beings in particular now cannot give feedback at scale.

We almost immediately took that code base and ripped it apart because, in order to do client after client, it meant we had to actually modify the code, and we wanted to stop modifying the code. So we ripped it apart, and we built it into something that could be configured. It was configured using a markup language called Yamo. We won't discuss the pros and cons of Yamo, but my guess is almost everyone in the room has not heard of it, which is one of the cons. And we could start configuring the system without changing the code base. Then we wrote on top of that something that we call initially called Pilot, and now is all full tilt Quill. It was a configuration model that allowed people who understood what they were doing, but didn't know how to program, to develop configurations for the system.

And that is, the need to communicate and the goal to communicate is absolutely the driver for every single piece of analysis that you need.
